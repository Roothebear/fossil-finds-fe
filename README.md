# Fossil Finds Front End

Fossil Finds is a web application allowing members of the public and researchers alike to search and contribute to a database of fossil finds in the UK. Fossil Finds Front End - the content of this repository - is the web application designed to interact with the back-end found in the repository Fossil-Finds-BE.
